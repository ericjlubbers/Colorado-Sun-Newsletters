<h1>Ski resorts&#8217; secret formula could be revealed</h1>

<p><em>Plus: A homemade chicken dinner now costs 40% more, a whole shop of opera workers unionize and judges to hear appeal to ruling that allows Trump on the ballot</em></p>

&nbsp;<hr />&nbsp;

<p style="line-height:24px;"><span style="font-size:48px;line-height:12px;">G</span>ood morning, Colorado.</p>

<p>We did our pre-Thanksgiving shopping yesterday. Picked up the turkey from a butcher, went to a wine shop and then hit two grocery stores to get everything we needed.</p>

<p>So now the turkey is in its brine. The cranberries are on the counter awaiting an orange juice bath. And sourdough bread is sitting out so we can get our stuffing texture just the way we like it.</p>

<p>Now, we all have one more work day until the big feast. Can&#8217;t make it through? Don&#8217;t worry, we have some articles to help you count down the hours on the clock.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving is tomorrow, but today we&#8217;re talking about chicken. The cost of a classic chicken dinner â€” including a salad, mashed potatoes and veggies on the side â€” has gone up 40% in the past five years. <strong>Jennifer Brown</strong> breaks it down cost by cost to show you why.</p>

<p>Crowds at some of Colorado&#8217;s biggest ski resorts have felt overwhelming in recent years. But are they too crowded? With ski areas staying mum, it&#8217;s hard to say. But a district court ruling last week could change that, <strong>Jason Blevins</strong> reports.</p>
