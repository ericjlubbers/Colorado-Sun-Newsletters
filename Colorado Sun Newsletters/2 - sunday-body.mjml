<p style="line-height:24px;"><span style="font-size:48px;line-height:12px;">G</span>ood Colorado Sunday morning, friends.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing to you on yet another day when the high is barely above freezing. I&#8217;m Colorado grown, so hardy. But, honestly, I&#8217;m growing weary of wearing a hat and down coat indoors because the utility company has put the fear of god and free-market economics in me and I&#8217;m afraid to turn up the heat. The anxiety about getting a supersized bill next month — which we all will — is unexpectedly elevated, perhaps because there is literally nothing I can do about it. It is cold everywhere and that&#8217;s jacking up the cost of heat everywhere.</p>

<p>This trouble beyond my control, though, is a minor inconvenience when I consider the people <strong>Michael Booth</strong> has written about for this week&#8217;s cover story. Duke Phillips and his multigenerational family in open bidding lost their State Land Board lease on the 86,000-acre Chico Basin Ranch. Name sound familiar? You may have read about the ranch in this newsletter two years ago when we <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/06/26/colorado-ranches-survival-ranchlands/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_source=The+Colorado+Sun+Newsletters&utm_campaign=*|MC:SUBJECT|*_*|DATE:Ymd|*&utm_medium=email">profiled the family&#8217;s commitment to conservation and to training the next generation of ranchers</a>. So where will the Phillipses — and their 1,500 cows — go next? Literally no one knows.</p>

Phillips is the founder and CEO of Ranchlands, a conservation-modeled cattle operation that has leased the 86,000-acre ranch owned by the Colorado Land Board for the past 24 years.

<p>I go through a half-dozen stages of grief just losing a major limb from a backyard tree.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve cared for that tree and watched it grow for 25 years — the harsh reality of change prompts denial, anger, blame, sadness, resignation.</p>

<p>%content-lock%</p>

<p>So it is and it isn&#8217;t possible for me to fathom the stages of grief the Phillips family will be going through for the next 11 months as they contemplate their world getting upended. It&#8217;s a bit more than one branch on one tree. It&#8217;s losing hundreds of thousands of acres of beloved land in Colorado after putting decades of work into the soil and animals. Moving hundreds of cattle and horses and three generations of family across the country.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s saying goodbye to everything from Pikes Peak to the antelope to a stubborn barn cat. And goodbye to thousands of visitors who came to Chico Basin Ranch or Zapata Ranch to get in touch with their Western roots, and left daydreaming of ranch life.</p>

<p>Our Sunday story is meant to appreciate the hard work it took to preserve and enhance a sprawling ranch that we, the public, own. And for the public to own the decision to let go the family who watched over it for 25 years.</p>

<p>If you know of a listing for a 300,000-acre fixer-upper with sweet water and 100-mile views, let the Phillipses know. It&#8217;s the least we can do.</p>

<p><strong>EXCERPT:</strong> Chaucer&#8217;s 14th-century &#8220;The Canterbury Tales&#8221; sets forth 24 stories, mostly told in verse, of people from diverse walks of life en route to the shrine of St. Thomas Becket. For author Josiah Hatch, that inspired the template for an updated version, with the storytellers&#8217; pilgrimage echoing themes in contemporary society while taking the form of a Caribbean cruise. Already a fan of poetry, Hatch adapted his stories to iambic pentameter and the result is some marvelous — and humorous —wordplay.</p>

<p><strong>THE SUNLIT INTERVIEW: </strong>Hatch, who studied Middle English in college, is a fan of Chaucer&#8217;s storytelling technique. Adapting the poetic style to the current social and political landscape wasn&#8217;t easy, but Hatch felt it was worth the effort. Here&#8217;s a slice of his Q&amp;A:</p>

<p><strong>SunLit: What were the biggest challenges you faced in writing this book?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hatch:</strong> Stamina and doubt were challenges. Rhymed couplets of iambic pentameter are not necessarily acceptable to modern audiences unless the reasons for their use are clear. I was kept working by the strong love of all sorts of poetry and the wish to share and to remind readers of the virtues of an approach that is seldom used in our time.</p>

And news of Senate Minority Leader Mike Lynch&#8217;s arrest for DUI back in 2022 leaked out — even though he asked the trooper who pulled him over not to notify the press. <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/01/19/mike-lynch-arrest-video-released/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_source=The+Colorado+Sun+Newsletters&utm_campaign=*|MC:SUBJECT|*_*|DATE:Ymd|*&utm_medium=email">&#8220;This will be a big deal,&#8221; Lynch said in video footage from the arrest</a> that <strong>Jesse Paul</strong> obtained under a Colorado Open Records Act request.</p>

<p>🌞 El Paso County is having problems hiring first responders, so it did what many inventive organizations do and started growing its own. <strong>Erica Breunlin</strong> went to Calhan, where she sat in on a class where high school students are getting the <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/01/17/colorado-springs-students-911-dispatchers-calhan/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_source=The+Colorado+Sun+Newsletters&utm_campaign=*|MC:SUBJECT|*_*|DATE:Ymd|*&utm_medium=email">skills to make them eligible to work as emergency dispatchers</a>.</p>

<p>🌞 The price of a pound of uranium hit a 16-year high a few days ago, but that&#8217;s not the only reason an Australian mining company is <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/01/17/uranium-mining-south-t-bar-ranch-canon-city-maybell/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_source=The+Colorado+Sun+Newsletters&utm_campaign=*|MC:SUBJECT|*_*|DATE:Ymd|*&utm_medium=email">nosing around claims in remote Fremont and Routt counties</a> that were proved up decades ago. <strong>Sue McMillan</strong> reports from a neighborhood west of Cañon City fighting to keep new exploration activities out of its meadows.</p>

<p>🌞 Mark and Julie Nygren are Johnstown farmers who didn&#8217;t mind sharing space with oil and gas. At least not until 2019, when a leaking natural gas pipeline contaminated their home so severely that it had to be demolished. <strong>Mark Jaffe</strong> <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/01/16/colorado-oil-gas-pipeline-safety-nygrens-firestone/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_source=The+Colorado+Sun+Newsletters&utm_campaign=*|MC:SUBJECT|*_*|DATE:Ymd|*&utm_medium=email">reports on the reluctant activists</a> who mostly got their way <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/01/18/leaking-natural-gas-pipeline-rules-colorado-puc/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_source=The+Colorado+Sun+Newsletters&utm_campaign=*|MC:SUBJECT|*_*|DATE:Ymd|*&utm_medium=email">when new pipeline safety rules were passed last week</a>.</p>

<p>🌞 Does managing recreation around America&#8217;s Mountain require the services of Colorado Parks and Wildlife? A coalition mulling the question for a few years thinks so. But its leaders told <strong>Jason Blevins</strong> this is <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/01/19/pikes-peak-recreation-colorado-parks-wildlife/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_source=The+Colorado+Sun+Newsletters&utm_campaign=*|MC:SUBJECT|*_*|DATE:Ymd|*&utm_medium=email">not a plan to turn Pikes Peak into another state park</a>.</p>

<p>🌞 No, we absolutely could not stop talking <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/01/15/massive-colorado-storm-road-closures-flights-canceled/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_source=The+Colorado+Sun+Newsletters&utm_campaign=*|MC:SUBJECT|*_*|DATE:Ymd|*&utm_medium=email">about snow</a> and <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/01/14/colorado-avalanche-berthoud-pass-sunday-morning/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_source=The+Colorado+Sun+Newsletters&utm_campaign=*|MC:SUBJECT|*_*|DATE:Ymd|*&utm_medium=email">avalanches</a> and <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/01/16/arctic-storm-colorado-blizzard-conditions/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_source=The+Colorado+Sun+Newsletters&utm_campaign=*|MC:SUBJECT|*_*|DATE:Ymd|*&utm_medium=email">frigid temperatures</a> this week. <strong>Shannon Mullane</strong> reports that the <a target="_blank"  href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/01/18/martin-luther-king-jr-weekend-snow-storms-much-needed-boost-colorado-water-supply/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_source=The+Colorado+Sun+Newsletters&utm_campaign=*|MC:SUBJECT|*_*|DATE:Ymd|*&utm_medium=email">weather-based mayhem helped revive a paltry snowpack</a>, and that has water watchers feeling optimistic.</p>
